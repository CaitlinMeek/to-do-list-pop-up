# to-do-list-pop-up
the code is intended to create a pop up, in which you can input a string of text.
the text will then be displayed in a list
users will have the option of selecting a item on a list and then have the capability to:
-delete that item off the list
-unselect the item
-set the item as 'important', 'work','personal','set time'

i wish for the program to be able to change the colour of the item on the list depending on each of the options
for 'set time', i wish for the user to be able to select a time in 24 hour clock
that time should then be displayed next to the label of the list item
if the program can link to the clock, could set it to give an alert on the display when that time occurs
